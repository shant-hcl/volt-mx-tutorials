# Contributing to Volt MX Tutorials

Reading and following these guidelines will help us make the contribution process easy and effective for everyone.

## Getting Started

### Issues

Issues should be used to report problems with the project, request a new feature, or to discuss potential changes before a PR is created. When you create a new Issue, a template will be loaded that will guide you through collecting and providing the information we need to investigate.

### Pull Requests

PRs to this repository are always welcome and can be a quick way to get your fix or improvement slated for the next release. In general, PRs should:

- Address a single concern in the least number of changed lines as possible.

- Include documentation by adding it in README.md if possible.

- Be accompanied by a complete Pull Request template (loaded automatically when a PR is created).

For changes that address core functionality or would require breaking changes, it's best to open an Issue to discuss your proposal first. This is not required but can save time creating and reviewing changes.

In general, PRs should:

1. Fork the repository to your own Github account

2. Clone the project to your machine

3. Create a branch locally with a succinct but descriptive name

4. Commit changes to the branch

5. Push changes to your fork

6. Open a PR in our repository (**master** branch) and follow the Pull Request template so that we can efficiently review the changes.
7. Please make sure your code compiles by running `npm run export`

If you raise a pull-request without having signed the **CLA**, you will be prompted to do so automatically.
